# Telegram Solana Trading Bot

A production-oriented Telegram bot that automates token discovery, execution, and portfolio tracking across the Solana ecosystem. The bot connects to Raydium AMM/CLMM pools, Jupiter, and Pump.fun to execute trades using Jito-powered transactions while managing user preferences and risk controls.

## Functional Overview

### Market Intelligence
- Continuously indexes Raydium, Jupiter, and Pump.fun liquidity pools to surface newly launched and trending tokens.
- Collects token metadata, pricing, and liquidity insights via Birdeye and on-chain RPC queries.
- Supports configurable filters for pool type, liquidity thresholds, and token whitelists/blacklists.

### Trade Execution
- Places market and limit-style orders for SPL tokens through Raydium CLMM/AMM and Jupiter swap routes.
- Uses Jito bundles to improve confirmation speed and protect against frontrunning.
- Integrates Pump.fun flows for early-stage tokens, including mint detection and auto-entry.

### Automation & Risk Controls
- Auto-buy and auto-sell rules driven by per-user configuration (size, slippage, take-profit, stop-loss).
- Scheduled tasks (cron) for rebalance, auto-sell, and liquidity/volume monitoring.
- Retry logic and transaction health checks to recover from RPC or network interruptions.

### Portfolio & Reporting
- Generates PnL summaries and trade history cards for delivery inside Telegram chats.
- Persists wallet activity, token positions, and configuration in MongoDB with Redis-backed caching.
- Exposes alerting hooks to broadcast fills, price moves, and rule-based notifications.

### Security Model
- Creates isolated guardian wallets for each user; private keys are never requested from end users.
- Supports configurable RPC endpoints (public/private) and WebSocket streams for state tracking.
- Environment-based secrets handling via `.env` and runtime validation.

## Requirements

- **Runtime:** Node.js 18+
- **Blockchain Access:** Solana RPC endpoint (HTTPS) and WebSocket endpoint; optional private RPC for high-throughput trading.
- **Datastores:** MongoDB cluster URI for persistent storage, Redis URI for caching/rate limiting.
- **Telegram:** Bot token generated via BotFather for each Telegram integration (trading bot, alert bot, bridge bot).
- **External Services:**
  - Jito account UUID for bundle submission.
  - Birdeye API key for market data enrichment.
  - Optional PnL image generator and GrowSol API endpoints if leveraging hosted services.

```

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**
	```sh
	npm install
	```
2. **Configure environment** by creating a `.env` file in the project root:
	```ini
	MONGODB_URL=
	REDIS_URI=

	GROWTRADE_BOT_ID=
	GROWSOL_ALERT_BOT_ID=
	BridgeBotID=
	ALERT_BOT_API_TOKEN=
	TELEGRAM_BOT_API_TOKEN=

	MAINNET_RPC=
	PRIVATE_RPC_ENDPOINT=
	RPC_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT=

	JITO_UUID=
	BIRD_EVE_API=
	GROWSOL_API_ENDPOINT=
	PNL_IMG_GENERATOR_API=
	```
3. **Run the bot**
	```sh
	npm run serve
	```

## Operational Notes

- Use `npm start` for a single-run execution (via `ts-node`) in production environments.
- Cron jobs and automated strategies rely on accurate system time; deploy on infrastructure with NTP synchronization.
- Monitor MongoDB and Redis resource usage when scaling concurrent Telegram sessions or automated strategies.
